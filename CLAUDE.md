# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a Chrome extension that automatically fills job application forms using uploaded resume data. The extension consists of a Python backend server for PDF parsing and a JavaScript frontend with Chrome extension components.

## Complete Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Server (PDF Processing)
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r enhanced_requirements.txt

# Start the enhanced backend server (includes PDF parsing and OCR)
python3 enhanced_backend_server.py
```
The backend server runs on `http://localhost:3000` and provides PDF parsing with OCR fallback.

### 2. LLM Server (Hybrid Mode)
```bash
# Install Ollama (if not already installed)
# For macOS: brew install ollama
# For Linux: curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Start Ollama server
ollama serve

# Pull the required model (in another terminal)
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```
The LLM server runs on `http://localhost:11434` and enables hybrid extraction mode.

### 3. Extension Setup
```bash
# Load the Chrome extension
# 1. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
# 2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right toggle)
# 3. Click "Load unpacked" and select this project folder
# 4. Extension will appear in Chrome toolbar

# Test the setup
node simple-test.js  # Verify LLM integration works
```

### Quick Start (Full Stack)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Python backend
python3 enhanced_backend_server.py

# Terminal 2: LLM backend  
ollama serve

# Terminal 3: Test everything
node simple-test.js

# Then load extension in Chrome and test on LinkedIn
```

### Testing Options

#### Hybrid Mode Testing
1. **Load extension** in Chrome (see setup above)
2. **Visit LinkedIn profile page** 
3. **Open extension popup** (click toolbar icon)
4. **Toggle hybrid mode** using "ðŸ¤– Use Hybrid Mode" checkbox
5. **Test extraction** with "ðŸ’¼ Extract from LinkedIn Profile"  
6. **Compare approaches** with "ðŸ§ª Test Hybrid vs Traditional"

#### Manual Testing
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors and extraction logs
- Monitor Python backend server logs for PDF parsing issues
- Test with various LinkedIn profile layouts to verify robustness
- Compare extraction quality between traditional and hybrid modes

#### Automated Testing
```bash
# Test LLM integration
node simple-test.js

# Test full extraction (requires LinkedIn page)
open test-hybrid.html  # In browser with extension loaded
```

## Architecture

### Backend Components
- **enhanced_backend_server.py**: Main Flask server with PDF parsing and OCR
- **backend/enhanced_server.py**: Alternative server implementation
- **backend/modules/resume_parser.py**: Resume parsing utilities

### Frontend Components
- **manifest.json**: Chrome extension configuration (Manifest V3)
- **popup.html/popup.js**: Extension popup interface for file upload and controls
- **background.js**: Service worker for extension background tasks
- **content/**: Content scripts injected into job sites
  - **content_main.js**: Main orchestrator for content script functionality
  - **formFiller.js**: Core form filling logic with site-specific selectors
  - **selectors.js**: Comprehensive field selectors for different job sites
  - **pageAnalyzer.js**: Dynamic page monitoring and form detection
  - **utils.js**: Utility functions for content scripts

### Modular JavaScript Architecture
- **js/modules/**: Reusable ES6 modules
  - **apiClient.js**: Backend API communication
  - **storageManager.js**: Chrome storage management
  - **uiManager.js**: UI state management
  - **formFiller.js**: Form filling coordination
  - **fileHandler.js**: File upload handling
  - **linkedinExtractor.js**: Traditional LinkedIn-specific data extraction (2458 lines)
  - **hybridLinkedInExtractor.js**: ðŸ¤– NEW - LLM-enhanced extraction with smart merging
  - **ollamaClient.js**: ðŸ¤– NEW - Local LLM integration for intelligent data processing
  - **config.js**: Configuration constants

### Data Flow

#### Traditional Mode
1. User uploads PDF resume via popup
2. Frontend sends PDF to backend server for parsing
3. Backend extracts text using PyPDF2, falls back to OCR if needed
4. Parsed data stored in Chrome storage
5. Content scripts detect form fields on job sites
6. Form filler matches resume data to appropriate fields using selectors
7. Fields are populated automatically

#### ðŸ¤– Hybrid Mode (NEW)
1. **LinkedIn Extraction**: Traditional scraper extracts raw data from DOM
2. **LLM Enhancement**: Raw content sent to local Ollama LLM for intelligent processing
3. **Smart Merging**: Best data from both approaches combined intelligently
4. **Quality Validation**: LLM validates, cleans, and enhances final output
5. **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to traditional if LLM unavailable
6. **Form Filling**: Enhanced data used for superior form field matching

### Supported Job Sites
- LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, Monster, ZipRecruiter
- Workday, Greenhouse, Lever
- Wantedly, Gaijinpot (Japanese job sites)

### Site-Specific Selectors
The extension uses a comprehensive selector system in `content/selectors.js`:
- Generic selectors for common field patterns
- Site-specific selectors for known job sites
- Multi-language support (English and Japanese)
- Fallback mechanisms for dynamic content

### Key Extension Features
- **ðŸ¤– Hybrid LLM Mode**: Revolutionary AI-enhanced extraction with local processing
- **Dynamic Content Monitoring**: Watches for form changes and new content
- **Smart Field Detection**: Uses multiple selector strategies
- **Multi-language Support**: Handles Japanese and English job sites
- **OCR Fallback**: Processes image-based PDFs when text extraction fails
- **Local Storage**: Resume data stays in browser for privacy
- **Intelligent Merging**: Combines traditional + AI results for superior quality
- **Zero Cloud Dependencies**: LLM runs entirely local via Ollama

## File Structure Notes
- Content scripts are loaded in order: utils.js, selectors.js, formFiller.js, pageAnalyzer.js, content_main.js
- Popup uses ES6 modules with import/export
- Backend uses Flask with CORS enabled for extension communication
- Icons and web-accessible resources defined in manifest.json

## Development Tips

### General
- **Python backend** must be running on port 3000 for PDF processing
- **Ollama LLM** must be running on port 11434 for hybrid mode (optional)
- Check browser console on job sites for content script logs
- Use Chrome DevTools to inspect form fields and selector matching
- Monitor backend server logs for PDF processing issues

### Hybrid Mode Debugging
- Use `node simple-test.js` to verify LLM connectivity
- Check popup hybrid mode toggle before testing
- Monitor console for "ðŸ¤–" prefixed LLM-related logs
- Test on different LinkedIn profile layouts for robustness
- Compare extraction quality between modes using test button

### Performance Notes
- Traditional extraction: ~500ms (fast, reliable)
- Hybrid extraction: ~2-5s (slower but much higher quality)
- LLM validation happens in background, doesn't block UI
- Graceful fallback ensures extension always works
